- What additional properties did you add to your models and why?

In Game Entity I added 'board' and 'winner'. The 'board' shows the state of the game.
The 'winner' shows the result of the game. 

In Score Entity I add 'winner' and 'point'. The 'winner' shows who will get the new points. 
The 'Point' show how much point will the winner get.

I alse added a new entity 'History' which recorded the game history. 
It contains 'game', 'move' and 'result'. When the user want to get the history of the game,
he or she can get the infomations from the history entity. The 'move' shows will position the user moved.
The 'result' show the message of who won the game.





- What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?

When I wanted to add a game history, I have to add a new entity 'History'. But at first I want to 
add a property 'history' in 'Game' entity, finally I failed to do that. Then I make a trade-off to 
create a new entity 'History' to records the messages. 

While doing the logic of the winner, I enumerated all situations of the board 
because I can not find a better way to calculate the result automatically.
